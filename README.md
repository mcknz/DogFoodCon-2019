## Get Some UI In Your CI
User interface testing has always been a little weird. Such tests are not easy to pull off, but if ignored, the risk is a bad experience for the very people our apps are supposed to serve. As technical practices evolved, from source control, to scheduled builds, through suites of unit tests,the barriers to automation have been relatively low, a combination of fire-and-forget activities strung together in a series of background commands. UI tests, however, have rarely fit this pattern. As teams move away from manually pointing and clicking around, and introduce UI test automation, often there's still a person pressing the ultimate button. There are amazing technologies for bringing the browser to life, but how do you get them into your development cycle? In this session, you'll learn how to design and build maintainable UI tests that can be run as part of continuous integration, using Cucumber and Selenium, in tools such as Jenkins and Azure DevOps for .NET and Java.
